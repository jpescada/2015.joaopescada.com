The 2015 version of my personal website

Built using an older version of [GulpJS](https://gulpjs.com/) to generate static HTML files and avoiding to repeat code. 

HTML because no server side language can deliver faster than static HTML, and I had enough time on my hands.

Shared the source here just in case it might of use to someone.
