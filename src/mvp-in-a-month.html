				<h3>“One month? Really?!”</h3>

				Sounds too good to be true? Well, it’s not. Really!<br>
				<br>
				In the last three years, I’ve delivered this type of solution multiple times, and the results keep justifying this as a solid investment to bring new digital products to market.<br>
				<br>
				When building a Minimum Viable Product, we need to aim for the smallest solution that delivers customer value. <br>
				<br>
				The MVP is (ideally) the second step you take, after validating a problem / solution fit with customer demand. If this is not the case, I suggest we take a <a href="/product-discovery.html">Product Discovery</a> session first.<br>
				<br>
				Once you’re ready, we define the scope of work with the restraint of building only 1 or 2 core features. This ensures a quick turnaround and a short and happy road to the real goal of an MVP: testing a prototype with your customers (and getting real feedback from them).<br>
				<br>
				I’m still fiddling with the process, so I’ll need a few more clients to test and help to improve this beta product. <em>(hint hint)</em><br>
				<br>
				If you are a brave person and want to put your idea to the test, please introduce yourself <strong><a href="#cta">using the form below</a></strong>.
