				<h3>What I can work&nbsp;on</h3>

				When working on consulting projects, I’m more than just a technical partner for your business.<br>
				<br>
				I can offer you a broader skillset, learned both by training and experience, that I just don’t offer as a contractor due to my preferred specialisation in front-end development.<br>
				<br>
				Instead of just offering my deep technical skills, I can also help you define, implement and refine business models, visual design, information architecture, user experience, as well as content and marketing strategies.<br>
				<br>
				All these extra thinking hats really come in handy, especially when your business is still at an early stage.<br>
				<br>
				Just for reference, these consulting projects – on average – last around two months from the initial conversation to delivery of the finished solution, costing about <span class="price" title="£15,000 / $19,000 / €17.000" data-price-gbp="£15,000" data-price-usd="$19,000" data-price-eur="€17.000">£15,000</span> in total. Now compare this with hiring a team of five or six professionals specialised in each of the skills I’m offering. You would easily be paying two to three times more.<br>
				<br>
				As any of my past clients can confirm, you’ll get a lot more valuable work (and revenue) from my full time dedication to your project, than you pay for.

				<h4>What kind of&nbsp;projects?</h4>

				<dl>

					<dt>Responsive Websites and&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Apps</dt>
					<dd>I can help you write and prepare the content (text, images, video, etc) and then I can handle everything else or help your team design, build, publish and promote a new website from scratch or just improve your existing one.</dd>

					<dt>Mobile Apps for Android&nbsp;and&nbsp;iOS</dt>
					<dd>Same as above with websites, I can help you get the content ready while I handle everything else about your mobile app, or I can just help your team bring the project to life.</dd>
