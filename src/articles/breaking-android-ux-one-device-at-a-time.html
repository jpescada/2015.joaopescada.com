				I consider myself a tech savvy guy, and never liked taking sides on OS flavours.<br>
				This article though, asserts my opinion on the current state of mobile OS’s based on my experience from a user point of view and well — maybe partly a rant.<br>
				<br>

				<h3>Looking back in time.</h3>

				When I was 11 (back in 1994), got my first PC (with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Intel486</a> CPU!) running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Windows 3.11</a>. The years went by and I kept getting other PCs, hardware upgrades and subsequent Windows OS versions (98, 2000 and XP).<br>
				<br>
				Only in 2003 I got my first introduction to other GUI-enabled OS: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac OS</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panther</a> (10.3). This grew my interest in alternative solutions to Windows, and led me to using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu</a> from 2004 as my main OS for both personal and work use.<br>
				<br>
				This move felt short when, in 2007, I started working full-time as a Flash Developer and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flash IDE</a> was only available in Windows or Mac flavours.<br>
				<br>
				Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Windows_Vista" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">many others</a>, I was never convinced with Windows Vista being a worthy upgrade, so I switched to Mac OS for both personal and work use.<br>
				<br>
				After enjoying the Mac OS experience for two years, in 2008, I also switched from my old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6230" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nokia 6230</a> to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_3GS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iPhone 3GS</a>, as soon as it was launched in Portugal.<br>
				<br>
				Again, years went by, multiple iOS upgrades happened and the device started feeling slower with nearly every new iOS iteration.<br>
				Luckily, in 2011, I was given an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iPhone 4</a> as a work phone, and could again get the iOS experience without sluggishness.<br>
				<br>
				Although I was using the work phone for both personal and work related tasks, I really had no mobile phone of my own for over a year, so being (self-restrained) gadget hungry as I am, I had to start looking for solutions.<br>
				<br>

				<h3>Not 2007 anymore.</h3>

				Being a happy iPhone and Mac user for a few years, the next iPhone generation seemed the most logical option.<br>
				<br>
				This was September 2012, and both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iPhone 5</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iOS 6</a> had been released in the wild. And albeit on the hardware side it’s a solid and tuned package, the software had a very unfortunate misturn, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/29/us-apple-cook-idUSBRE88R0SN20120929" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">breaking basic smartphone functionalities</a> that left too many users in the dark. A mess much comparable to the one Microsoft did with Windows Vista.<br>
				<br>
				Since this whole situation got me thinking, and questioning whether it was really worth getting the new iPhone, I started digging in the internet and looking for reviews on the current mobile panorama.<br>
				<br>
				Both Microsoft and Google had their mobile phone trial and errors and were finally catching up with their own innovative mobile solutions.<br>
				<br>
				The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metro</a> interface used in Windows Phones teased me for a while, but since I use a lot of Google products, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Galaxy Nexus</a> was no longer the flagship Android phone, I decided to give the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_III" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Galaxy S3</a> a run for its money.<br>
				<br>

				<h3>The (almost) Android experience.</h3>

				At start, the Galaxy S3 seems very similar in performance and functionality to the latest iPhone generations.<br>
				<br>
				But after the first experience, I started noticing some inconsistencies across apps in both visuals and interactions. Things like gestures not triggering the same expected action or simply poorly designed interfaces. In comparison, I must confess, the iOS UX might have spoilt me.<br>
				<br>
				This didn’t hold me back. Again, I googled and found that my device was still not running the latest OS version, even though it had been released about 3 months before.<br>
				<br>
				After some research I confirmed what I had long forgotten from my Windows experience: hardware vendors tend to run their own customised versions of the OS.<br>
				<br>
				Unfortunately, the same happens with Android.<br>
				<br>
				Google releases the new OS, and then every manufacturer / operator will add their own layer of software, replacing or just removing the original functionalities. Only then (months later; and even later, if the device is unlocked!) the users are able to update their devices to the latest OS release.<br>
				<br>
				Now, if only the customisation was a real improvement on the original Android experience, AND delivered on time (say… up to a month later?) it would still be worth waiting for it. But no. The added apps are mostly crapware, and the replaced ones even downgrade the original UX. Waiting almost 4 months for this? I don’t think so.<br>
				<br>
				A bit more of research revealed an even harsher truth, by-product of this “customisation”: over 50% of Android devices in use, are running still Gingerbread, a nearly 2 years old OS version, with the latest OS version (Jelly Bean) running in less than 3% of devices. (<a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">official Android statistics</a>).
				Where as in iOS devices over 50% are already running the latest iOS 6. (there’s no official up-to-date statistics on this, but latest <a href="http://insights.chitika.com/2012/ios-by-device/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">unofficial statistics</a> point to 60% of devices running iOS 6).<br>
				<br>

				<h3>Back to iPhone?</h3>

				Nop. At least not yet. Sure, my first Android experience is not being as good as expected but, since a few days ago, there’s another alternative.<br>
				The new Android phone from Google: the <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexus 4</a>.<br>
				<br>
				With a tight connection between software and hardware, this should allow Google to continue delivering an experience closer to what Apple got their iPhone users familiar with. Including updates delivered on time.<br>
				<br>
				If according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matias_Duarte" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Matias Duarte</a> (Director of Android UX at Google), <a href="https://plus.google.com/114892667463719782631/posts/NWdbD1AmyTA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">it’s only a third of the way</a> to where he wants the Android experience to be, I will be very happy with my next Android phone.<br>
				<br>
				Hopefully, it will be the Android experience I was expecting in the first place.<br>
				And probably the phone I should have waited for, before jumping the gun and buying one dependent on a third-party.<br>
				<br>
				Otherwise is just as good as a Blackberry.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks for reading through!<br>
