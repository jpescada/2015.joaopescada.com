				This was on my to-do list for quite some time… now I can scratch it of the list!<br>
				<br>
				I’ve been willing to share source code of “real world” projects where I’ve been involved for ages! Not that I see my work as something über-awesome or anything for that matter… But the same way I’ve been lost in code and ended up finding “The” solution in a post from some random mate on the other side of the globe, so can someone find this post — and future ones — as a resource of great value. And, as a bonus, leave work on time. :)<br>
				<br>


				<h3>Sharing is a good thing. Really!</h3>

				We, (Web / Flash / Interactive / Multimedia) Developers, live in a not-so-big community where rookies, juniors, seniors, gurus, veterans, ninjas and any-other-fancy-title-out-there need to work together to evolve our skills both personal and group-wise. And with working together I don’t mean geographically, but really as a whole cohesive community where we not only take from, but also give back in the same proportion.<br>
				<br>
				With this in mind, and fueled by <a href="http://www.indiferentlounge.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nuno Ribeiro</a>‘s talk at 2010 edition of <a href="http://www.flashcampportugal.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FlashCamp Portugal</a> — where he referred the must-read post of <a href="http://portfolio.marcosneves.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marco Neves</a> “<a href="http://www.marcosneves.com/blog/2010/09/22/porque-partilhar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Porque partilhar???</a>“ (<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.marcosneves.com/blog/2010/09/22/porque-partilhar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Why share???</a> by Google Translate) —, I’ve decided to create an online repository for sharing code at <a href="http://github.com/jpescada" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a>.<br>
				<br>


				<h3>The project and its source code.</h3>

				So, today was “The Day” and I finally published the first source code of a “real world” project I’ve worked on this year.<br>
				It’s a simple 3D scene with draggable cubes take cast shadows on the ground. A striped down version of the scene used in the website <a href="http://www.oonique-candles.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">oonique candles</a> for <a href="http://www.oonsolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">oon solutions</a>.<br>
				<br>
				It’s coded in Actionscript 3.0 using <a href="http://blog.papervision3d.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Papervision3D</a> + <a href="http://www.jiglibflash.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JigLibFlash</a> 3D physics library + Andy Zupko’s <a href="http://blog.zupko.info/?p=146" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ShadowCaster</a> + <a href="http://www.greensock.com/tweenlite/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TweenLite</a> for camera transitions and the help of loads of posts in blogs and forums all over the internet to overcome some problems I’ve faced during development.<br>
				<br>
				As you can now infer, such a simple thing and — yet! — hundreds of people were involved so I could build up this one.<br>
				<br>
				There aren’t much comments throughout the source code, but I’m always around if you need some help understanding something in it. Drop me an e-mail and I’ll write back.<br>
				<br>
				The source code is available for download here:<br>
				<a href="http://github.com/jpescada/PV3D-Boxes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/jpescada/PV3D-Boxes</a>.<br>
				<br>
				And a working demo is available here:<br>
				<a href="http://demo.joaopescada.com/pv3d-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://demo.joaopescada.com/pv3d-boxes</a>.<br>
				<br>
				Go get your hands dirty and feel free to use it as you see fit.<br>
				This goes without saying, but any credits will be much appreciated.<br>
				<br>
				Now… I have to get back to work.<br>
				And thanks for reading till the end! :)<br>
