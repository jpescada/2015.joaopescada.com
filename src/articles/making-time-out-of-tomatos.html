				A few weeks ago, I had a workshop on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_development" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Personal Development</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/DanielSaNogueir" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">@DanielSaNogueir</a> / <a href="http://www.wecreate.pt/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">We Create</a>, and found the need to manage time in a more effective way, in order to reach my goals (amongst a lot of other new and awesome things I’ve learned there — but that’s a whole new post that will get it’s 15-minutes-of-fame some other day in this blog).<br>
				<br>
				Now fast-forwarding to last week.<br>
				<br>
				Last week, reading my Twitter’s timeline, found a tweet of <a href="http://twitter.com/quodis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">@Quodis</a>, on <a href="http://twitter.com/quodis/status/5398699824" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">welcoming their newest team member</a>: <a href="http://twitter.com/Leihla" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">@Leihla</a>. Being a follower of <a href="http://www.quodis.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quodis</a>‘ work and having some free time on my hands, I went to check on Leihla’s Twitter account to find out more about her. Suddenly, a simple hashtag got my full attention: <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23time" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">#time</a> on the following tweet “<a href="http://twitter.com/Leihla/status/5065198752" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tried the pomodoro technique and saw some improvements on my time management</a>“.<br>
				<br>
				* Ding! Ding! *<br>
				<br>
				I had to find more on this “pomodoro technique”. And so I did: <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Pomodoro Technique</a>, the official website on the subject.<br>
				<br>
				The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method, created in 1992 by <a href="http://cirillosscrapbook.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Francesco Cirillo</a> as a way to improve his own study habits. Since then it has been taught and practiced by professional individuals and teams all over the world.<br>
				<br>
				The name Pomodoro, means tomato in italian, and it was adopted due to using a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=tomato%20timer&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">kitchen timer (tomato shaped)</a> to keep track of the time.<br>
				<br>
				The success of this technique relies on a few simple rules:<br>
				– work with your focus on a single task for 25 minutes (a Pomodoro unit — an indivisible time measurement unit);<br>
				– then take a 5 minute break;<br>
				– repeat the last two steps, until the task is finished and the active Pomodoro ended;<br>
				– every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break, like 30 minutes.<br>
				<br>
				These are the basic rules, but there’s a lot more to add to it. For a deeper study, I recommend reading the Book (in PDF or printed version) <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources.html#pomodorobook" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available on the official site</a>.<br>
				<br>
				Right from the first day I started using this technique, results came up. Not only I enhanced my productivity, but also found a lot of interruptions I didn’t noticed they existed before (as interruptions / <a href="http://www.giantimpact.com/articles/read/article_momentum_breakers_vs_momentum_makers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">momentum breakers</a>).<br>
				<br>
				In fact, this system enables a lot more then just improving productivity, it increases awareness of decisions and determination to reach objectives, building motivation that will fuel more productivity.<br>
				<br>
				In resume, it’s a methodology so simple, one can learn it in… well… a Pomodoro. (I had to pull this one off!)<br>
				<br>
				As a final note, the set of tools I use to implement the Pomodoro Technique:<br>
				– <a href="http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pomodoro Desktop</a>, a free Mac status bar application to track time;<br>
				– <a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Hit List</a>, a beta (free by now) release of a Mac application for task management.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Update:</strong><br>
				An alternative desktop timer, platform independent (AIR-based), is <a href="http://www.focusboosterapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Focus Booster</a>.<br>
				<br>
				So… feeling the need to take control of your productivity time?<br>
