				<h3>The basics</h3>

				I’m <span itemprop="name">João Pescada</span>, a nice guy in his thirties from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algarve" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" itemprop="birthPlace">south of Portugal</a>, currently living in <span itemprop="homeLocation">London</span> with his <a href="http://anaemiliasilva.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lovely wife</a> and <a href="http://mia.pescada.pt/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cute dog</a>.<br>
				<br>
				I make my living helping businesses create digital products and services.<br>
				Usually in the form of websites or mobile apps. And sometimes <a href="/works/hiscox.html">interactive pieces</a> that make grown-ups in suits happier than kids on Christmas day.<br>
				<br>
				Back in 2002, I launched an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030127085826/http://www.digitalevo.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">online magazine</a> featuring digital artists and projects that helped thousands of Portuguese and Brazilian designers, developers and photographers sharing knowledge and fostering collaborations for years to come. This project alone allowed me to meet a great bunch of people that helped me get where I am today.<br>
				<br>
				A couple of years later, when I was still investing a lot of time drawing and illustrating, I got my work featured in a book of contemporary illustrators called <a href="http://idnworld.com/idnpro/?id=musa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MusaBook</a>. I didn’t brag much about it, but I felt really proud at the time (well, I still am!).<br>
				<br>
				And all this was before I started taking work too seriously.<br>
				<br>
				Then, I started focusing more on the technical side of digital products, leaving my designer life lagging a bit behind. But this was not the worst decision, as it still let to a few gold and silver awards from the <a href="http://clubecriativos.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Creatives Club of Portugal</a> and a Site of the Day award from <a href="http://www.thefwa.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The FWA</a>.

				<h3>Personally</h3>

				I love travelling. Finding new places. Immersing in another culture. It’s addictive and as such, never enough.<br>
				<br>
				So when I’m not travelling, I take option B and reward myself with being a tourist in my own city. If I’m not in front of the computer, I’m probably outside exploring the world with my camera. Or… maybe I’m just walking the dog somewhere near my house.<br>
				<br>
				Did I mention I love travelling? That and trying new food. And taking photos. And reading books that get me thinking in new and different ways.<br>
				<br>
				On the other hand, I’m a calm and quiet person and I also enjoy drawing and writing. It relaxes my busy mind. But I’ve been too lazy to do these often enough. I’m getting into meditation instead.<br>
				<br>
				Sports? You mean motorsports, right? I follow MotoGP, WRC and Formula-E. But I like running and cycling. Just practising, not watching others do it.<br>
				<br>
				Oh! I haven’t had a single TV at home nor owned a car for eight years. <br>
				Sold my first and only car when I moved to Lisbon and started using public transportation instead. I love driving and this was a tough decision where logic had to intervene. But I still drive a car whenever travelling “requires” it.

				<h3>Collaborating</h3>

				You’re still with me? Good!<br>
				Have you enjoyed knowing me a bit better?<br>
				<br>
				I enjoy working with nice people because everything becomes so much easier. Time is too precious to spend it doing something you <em>dislike</em>.<br>
				<br>
				If I had to choose, I would prefer working with small businesses with stable revenue streams. Investor backed companies don’t always think about the long-term impact of their actions. So growing a unicorn quickly just to sell it later to the highest bidder, is <em>usually</em> not my cup of tea.<br>
				<br>
				I work hard, so that anyone telling a friend about me can say this:<br>
				“He’s a nice guy. He knows his trade and I’m sure he can help you succeed. Talk to him!”<br>
				<br>
				If you want to be one of my friendly clients, I’ll joyfully welcome you.<br>
				<a href="/contact.html">Get in touch</a>, even if it’s just for a quick chat.<br>
				<br>
				If you’re ready to take a step ahead, have a <a href="/products.html">look at my products</a> first. <br>
				Or you can always get my advice for free by <a href="/signup.html">joining my private email list</a>.<br>
				<br>
				Thank you for your time. Hope you have a nice day. :)<br>
