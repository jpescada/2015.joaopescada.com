				<h3>What I can work&nbsp;on</h3>

				Currently, I’m only accepting contract roles for <strong>front-end development</strong>.<br>
				<br>
				I can create responsive websites and web apps as well as hybrid mobile apps.<br>
				<br>
				My preferred technology stack is HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript for modern (desktop and mobile) browsers.<br>
				<br>
				I regularly use Angular or React, SASS, Bootstrap or Foundation, NPM, Gulp or Grunt, Bower, Karma, Jasmine, Node, PHP, Python and Cordova / PhoneGap.<br>
				<br>
				Lengthwise, I prefer contracts from a minimum of 3 weeks up to a maximum of 12 months.<br>
				<br>
				Less than 3 weeks usually means patching someone else’s work on a tight deadline, which is not the best use of my time nor your money. More than 12 months is a red flag for too much internal bureaucracy or becoming part of the furniture, which is not optimal for neither parties.<br>
				<br>
				As a guide, my daily rate ranges between <span class="price" title="£400 / $500 / €450" data-price-gbp="£400" data-price-usd="$500" data-price-eur="€450">£400</span> and <span class="price" title="£650 / $950 / €850" data-price-gbp="£650" data-price-usd="$950" data-price-eur="€850">£650</span> (+VAT), depending on the complexity of the project and <a href="/availability">my&nbsp;availability</a>.
