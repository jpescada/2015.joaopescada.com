				<h3>A nicer thank&nbsp;you</h3>

				Even though I don’t have the actual numbers to prove it, I would say that at least 80% of the work I’ve done as a freelancer came from referrals. Referrals from friends, from happy clients and from people who never met me, but know my work. I’m really grateful for this.<br>
				<br>
				So as a way to show my appreciation for these gestures, I’m offering a referral scheme: if you recommend me to someone with whom I end up doing business, I’ll give you a <strong><span class="price" data-price-gbp="£100" data-price-eur="€150" data-price-usd="$150">£100</span> Amazon voucher</strong>. <em>Simples!</em><br>
				<br>
				It’s not a fortune, but I think it’s a nicer way to thank you for your kindness.<br>

				<h3>How does it&nbsp;work?</h3>

				As I mentioned above, this is just an extra way for me to say thank you for helping me. And with this in mind, I hope you don’t see it as “easy money”. The same way I send extra work to fellow freelancers (and agencies), I appreciate when others send work to me.<br>
				<br>
				The rules are short, simple and hopefully clear:<br>
				<ol>
					<li>I’ll give the voucher only to the person who recommended me;</li>
					<li>For ease of reference, the referral should come via email from a person with whom I’ll be doing business. Just ask for your name to be mentioned when they contact me;</li>
					<li>This might be obvious but, vouchers will only be given for contacts that lead to paid work;</li>
					<li>Similarly, I’ll send your voucher only after my first invoice is paid;</li>
					<li>And lastly, this offer is not available for recruiters. Sorry.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				In short: you send them my way, they mention your name, I do my work, I get paid and you get your voucher via email.<br>
				<br>
				Sounds like a sweet deal? <br>
				Cool! Then please send them my way! :)<br>
				<br>
				If you have any questions about this, just <a href="mailto:joao@pescada.pt?subject=About%20the%20referral%20scheme">email me</a> first.<br>
				<br>
				Thank you.<br>
