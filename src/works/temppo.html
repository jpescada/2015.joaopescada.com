				What initially started as a proof of concept in the summer of 2013, became then a personal project to learn the intricacies of building and publishing a web app as a paid mobile app for Android and iOS on multiple app stores.<br>
				<br>
				Temppo is a minimalist weather app that displays the weather conditions based on the user’s current location.<br>
				<br>
				It’s simple interface allows to switch between the current, later and tomorrow’s weather conditions.<br>
				On each screen, it features animated weather icons with the background colour reflecting the temperature and a little hint of humor to put a smile on the user’s face not matter how crappy the weather may be.<br>
				<br>
				To support the app, I also created a responsive one-page website featuring the app’s benefits, app store links, social network profiles and legalese required.<br>
				<br>
				Being this a personal project, I took charge of all tasks and wore multiple hats. From setting and enforcing constraints of time and budget as a client and producer would do, to first designing the user experience, and then the user interface and testing both the mobile app and support website.<br>
				<br>
				With little to no promotion, the app gathered only a small user base in the very crowded market of weather apps but allowed me to learn a lot in the process. And it still managed to cover that year’s Apple Developer license. That’s still a win in my book!<br>
				<br>

				<h4>Feedback</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Gorgeous, minimal and to the point with a hint of humor. Perfect for someone who simply wants to know what the temperature is and couldn’t care less what the dew point in Antarctica is.</p>

				<h4>Technical</h4>
				The app is built using HTML5, CSS3 and a custom event-driven Javascript framework to connect with a third party API for weather data (Weather Underground) and then compiled in Android and iOS apps using Phonegap.<br>
				The website uses the Bootstrap framework and just a little Javascript to sprinkle the experience.<br>
