				Between 2014 and 2015, I worked closely with the international consultancy Capco to help them bring to life a fully functional mobile app for Natwest. Being part of a testing bed for new products, this app was designed to help Natwest customers get a better understanding of their personal finances.<br>
				<br>
				By using everyday language and merging user-friendly interfaces with customer data enhanced by machine learning, the app helped users on three key areas: tracking their spending habits, budgeting on a monthly basis and setting goals for their savings.<br>
				<br>
				And to keep us focused on developing a great product based on real feedback, we invited a select group of real customers that tested all the functionalities, integrated with real data from their bank accounts.<br>
				<br>

				<h4>Technical</h4>
				The mobile app was built in HTML5, Sass and AngularJS and integrated with REST backend and third party APIs (like LivePerson) and protected end-to-end with bank-grade security. To allow distribution via app stores the web app was also compiled as a hybrid app using Phonegap. As a side note, I must mention that the frontend was built by a group of four developers, myself included.<br>
				<br>
