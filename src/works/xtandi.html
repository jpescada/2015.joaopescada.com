				While working for VCCP, we were tasked with building a digital detail aid, a document containing product information that is used by pharmaceutical sales representatives to engage physicians in a productive dialog about a drug.<br>
				<br>
				As the campaign for this drug involved an old man sitting on a crate as a metaphor to containing the problem, we picked up from there and followed with the idea.<br>
				<br>
				Since the content was required to be always available offline and preferably presented in a familiar way, we decided to package it as an iPad app.<br>
				<br>
				Starting from the campaign video, we used the exterior faces of the crate as a base to display the information. For navigation (besides the menu), we allowed rotating the crate right and left as a linear back and forth navigation and up and down to dig deeper in the content.<br>
				<br>
				To enhance the experience, we also added little details like shadows and other free elements moving slightly as the user moved through the content and tilted the device.<br>
				<br>

				<h4>Technical</h4>
				This mobile app was built in HTML5, making a good use of CSS3 transitions and animations and enhanced with a Javascript foundation to handle user interactions and communicating with the Phonegap framework in which the web app was wrapped.<br>
