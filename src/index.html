				<strong>My name is João Pescada.  <br>
				I’m an independent technologist and consultant based in London.</strong><br>
				<br>
				For over a decade, I’ve been creating digital products that deliver results for more clients that I can count. Most have solved big challenges, but some even ended up excelling their business goals.<br>
				<br>
				To every project, I bring in my full dedicated attention, a creative but pragmatic use of technology and clear-cut advice supported by a long-standing experience of all-things-internet.<br>
				<br>
				For reference, these are some of the amazing brands and clients I’ve been fortunate enough to work with:<br>
				<br>
				<img src="/assets/images/brands-logos@2x.png" alt="easyJet, Galp Energia, Halifax Bank, Hiscox, Lloyds Bank, L’Oréal, Mondelez, NatWest Bank, Remax, Star Alliance, Telefónica O2, Vale do Lobo" class="brands-img lazy-load lazy-load-delay-3"><br>
				<br>
				If you’re in for a bit of light reading, both my <a href="/cv">curriculum (PDF)</a> and <a href="/about.html">biography</a> are available online.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<small>* That’s “hello!” in Portuguese. Yes, I’m also Portuguese, and it’s ok if you can’t pronounce my first name; English-natives usually have trouble with it. But if you still want to give it go, try saying <em>zhwaun</em> (it’s not exactly the same, but sounds quite close!). And yes, I’ve been grey-haired since a <em>really</em> early age. I blame it on bad genes. :)</small>

				<h3>What I do</h3>

				In one sentence: I merge ideas with technology. <br>
				Or at least that’s what I like to say. It’s abstract enough to cover most of what I do, yet it specifies the two major components: ideas and technology.<br>
				<br>
				With <strong>creative agencies</strong> I enhance teams with technical and user experience capabilities and help find the best ways to express digital work for their clients. <a href="/agencies.html">Find out how I can help agencies&nbsp;<span class="icon icon-link-arrow"></span></a><br>
				<br>
				With <strong>startups and small businesses</strong> I help defining a solution for the problem at hand, refining it to better serve their customers and growing it to a successful product. <a href="/startups.html">Find out how I can help startups&nbsp;<span class="icon icon-link-arrow"></span></a><br>
				<br>
				Depending on your location we can collaborate in-house or remotely.<br>
